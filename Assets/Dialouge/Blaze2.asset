    - text: "David huh, well colour me intrigued, it\u2019s been a hella long time
        since I heard that name. What exactly you want with him?"
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: "I\u2019m writing a book about him and the west."
      speaker: David
    - text: Shit kid, I could save you the time and you could write your book about
        me instead.
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: "Sadly I\u2019ve already committed too much to give up now sir, I just
        need some info on what he was like and where he might have ended up."
      speaker: David
    - text: Hopefully rotting in hell, that piece of scum left me for dead after
        a job went wrong so I pray that fuckers dead.
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: "Weren\u2019t the two of you partners? I mean isn\u2019t there more to
        your relationship than that one moment?"
      speaker: David
    - text: Sure, I mean for a time we were friends, brothers even but after that,
        how could you expect me to say kind things about him. Say if someone stabbed
        you in the back would you speak kindly of them?
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: Not exactly, I just expected more, you know, I heard stories of outlaws
        who, while ruthless, acted as almost unlawful heroes of the west.
      speaker: David
    - text: "Jesus, come on kid this isn\u2019t a fairytale, there are no happy endings
        out here and your outlaw definitely ain\u2019t no hero."
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: "He was one ruthless son of bitch, me and him did so much damage to this
        town, it wouldn\u2019t have bounced back if I hadn\u2019t stayed."
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: What do you mean by that exactly?
      speaker: David
    - text: "Well me and Cass were scoping this place out and \u2026 wait a second."
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: "God damn boy you almost had me there but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d noticed
        by now that nothin around here is free."
      speaker: Blaze
    - text: '''Sigh'', what''s your price?'
      speaker: David
    - text: "I don\u2019t want your money, got plenty of my own. No we\u2019re gonna
        play a game, winner takes all, loser leaves in a coffin."
