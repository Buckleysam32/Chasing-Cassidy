Carson Smith:So how’d it go kid
David:Fairly well, here’s Miss Brown’s money, Mr Harris’s and here’s Mr Hill’s money
Carson Smith:Well this is a surprise. Honestly didn’t think he’d earn enough for this one but I guess miracles are possible sometimes. Might even raise his price for next month considering this. 
Carson Smith:Well you’ve held up your end of the bargain so here's a little bit of info that should serve you quite well. See that shady little door behind the bar?
David:Yeah, What is it?
Carson Smith:That my friend is where you’ll meet an associate of mine named Blaze Adams. He’s a powerful and popular man around here who just happens to be the former partner to Cold Cassidy. 
Carson Smith:I’m sure he's going to be intrigued by your story so why don’t you go down there and introduce yourself
David:Alright I will, thanks for the information
Carson Smith:No thank you my good sir, made me quite the profit today. Good luck
