David:Excuse me sir? Is your name Morris Hill?
MorrisHill:Afraid so but unfortunately we’re closed at the moment mister so you’ll have to come back tomorrow for any of our services.
David:Well I’m actually not here to purchase any goods sir, I’m actually here on behalf of Mr Carson Smith
Morris Hill:Now mister, I don’t want any trouble. Please just leave, tell him that I’ll pay later, we’re under hard times at the moment, can’t afford no bullshit service fee and he knows that.
David:I’m not here to cause any harm sir, I’m simply here to collect so if you could even provide a fraction of the fee, I’m sure Carson would be somewhat satisfied.
Morris Hill:You don’t understand! We don’t have anything left, I can’t even afford the basic medicine to save my boy let alone pay a ridiculous fee to that thief. Please just find a way to convince him to give us more time. 
Morris Hill:I’m begging you, just do something. I know you don’t owe me anything but I just need this one thing ok.
David:Ok, um, I’ll see what I can do sir
Morris Hill:Thankyou
