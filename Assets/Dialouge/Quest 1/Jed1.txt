David:Hello sir, how are you doing?
Jed Harris:As fine as one can these days, also no need to call me sir kid, I ain’t exactly an old man yet. Names Jed. Anyhow, what are you looking for, you don’t exactly look like the kind of person who would make use of my wares no offence of course
David:You’d be right to assume that, no I’m here on the behalf of a Mr Smith, I believe you have a deal with him and I’m here to collect
Jed Harris:And here I was thinking you came here for my company. I’m kidding of course, I'm aware of the deal and I do have the money right here. 
Jed Harris:However, you better make sure to let him know that if he increases the price again I’ll report him to the sheriff office, I won’t be made a fool by anyone, especially someone as high and mighty as Carson Smith
David:Understood sir, have a good day
