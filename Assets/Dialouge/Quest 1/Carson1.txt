Carson Smith:Good day sir, my name is Carson smith, I heard you were looking for a particularly dangerous man and well you’re in luck I have quite a few diverse acquaintances that fall into that category
David:Um ok how exactly did you know that sir?
Carson Smith:News travels quickly around these parts, especially when you’re a level above the commoners around here. 
Carson Smith:You understand being a fellow academic of course, the people around here are lowly savages. Speaking of which, how about this deal son? 
Carson Smith:You see an associate of mine has fallen ill so it would be grand if you could take his place. 
Carson Smith:All you need to do is go around to a couple of stores which I have enlisted my services to and collect my service fee from them and then I’ll provide you with some good info related to that allusive outlaw you seek
David:Sounds fair enough I guess, although I don’t have any weapons so I won’t be able to force any of them to provide funds
Carson Smith:Don’t fear good sir, If any of them decide to wake snakes then just come back here and I’ll sort it. Now here's the list of places utilising my service and meet me here once you’re done.
