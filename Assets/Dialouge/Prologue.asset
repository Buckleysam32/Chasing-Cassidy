    - text: Legends. As a boy, I heard stories about these Legendary gunslingers
        who could shoot as fast as the wind and ride as quick as a cheetah.
      speaker: David
    - text: "These days, they seem to be nothing but fading whispers disappearing
        with the rise of \u2018civilization\u2019 and those who remain have descended
        into reckless murder and madness."
      speaker: David
    - text: So I wondered what happened to these legends of the past and are they
        really as legendary and dangerous as we were once led to believe.
      speaker: David
    - text: That is why I, David Williams, a writer and avid scholar, will spend
        the next few weeks travelling through the two towns with the last known rumours
        and sightings of the outlaw Cassidy Miller.
      speaker: David
    - text: "To find out what truly becomes of a legend when their story ends. This
        book will act as not only a record of my findings but also as a diary of
        my journey through the \u2018Wild\u2019 West."
