    - text: So what exactly is it that you wanted to know about Cassidy?
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: Well first off, what do you four know about him?
      speaker: David
    - text: "Same story everyone else heard, he, alongside the sundancers gang, went
        across America taking as much money and other valuable things from the west,
        east and south. Would\u2019ve gone north if the gang didn\u2019t run into
        some issues"
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: After that he ran with Blaze Adams for a short time before disappearing.
        Leaving only a gravestone in Robertsville.
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: I was led to believe that you may have had some new information for me
      speaker: David
    - text: "We don\u2019t but she might, claimed to be Cassidy\u2019s Ex. Probably
        just said it to try and scare us off but there\u2019s always a chance."
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: Ok well can chat with her?
      speaker: David
    - text: Well duh, shes right here jackass
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: ...
      speaker: David
    - text: You might be want to ask those questions quickly, cause the bitch is
        really startin' to get on our nerves
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: "Ok, I\u2019m sorry about your current predicament, could you tell me
        your name?"
      speaker: David
    - text: "Jolene Wilson and it\u2019s nice to meet someone whos actually got some
        intelligence for once"
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: "Uh thanks I guess, so were you actually Cassidy\u2019s wife or lover?"
      speaker: David
    - text: Wife and yeah it feels like a lifetime ago now but I was for a time
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: What was he like?
      speaker: David
    - text: "\u201CHe \u2026 he was amazing, spent every moment caring for others.
        There was something about him, something beautiful and kind but also hurt"
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: "For a time, he was so good to me that I became blinded to the moments
        that weren\u2019t as good. When the sparkle in his eye would dissolve and
        the life he didn\u2019t tell me about was exposed. The outlaw would be exposed."
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: And here I was beginning to dread that he was going to be exactly like
        Blaze
      speaker: David
    - text: "No no, while I don\u2019t know much about their escapades I do know
        that he wouldn\u2019t commit violence without a reason whether that was a
        logical or emotional reason would depend but he would always try to help
        someone."
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: "But it wasn\u2019t always the right person was it?"
      speaker: David
    - text: "No, I just wish he was honest earlier. I found out about his early life
        at a period of pain for both of us and well I guess, we both just couldn\u2019t
        handle it anymore"
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: "Why was it already painful at that time? If you don\u2019t mind me asking"
      speaker: David
    - text: "We uh \u2026 had just lost our daughter and had begun fighting each
        other in the heat of mourning instead of uniting to push through it."
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: "I\u2019m sorry, my condolences."
      speaker: David
    - text: "That doesn\u2019t matter now, I don\u2019t see me making it out of here.
        At least not without a few extra scars"
      speaker: Jolene
    - text: "I\u2019ll see what we can do."
      speaker: David
    - text: "I appreciate what you have done for me here gentlemen but \u2026"
      speaker: David
    - text: "If you think she\u2019s leaving with you, you're not as educated as
        we thought."
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: While you two were having your little sappy chat, we were thinking over
        what you was saying earlier about what you heard about us. And we were wondering
        how exactly you knew about where we were and what we was doing here?
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: "I uh \u2026 heard it from some locals "
      speaker: David
    - text: You might want to spill the truth before we make you spill your guts.
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: Fine! I heard it from the other member of your gang.
      speaker: David
    - text: Oh you little fucker, let me guess you came from Robertsville. You might
        have led them right to us!
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: "No, I swear I didn\u2019t tell the deputies anything! Please, you gotta
        believe me!"
      speaker: David
    - text: "It doesn\u2019t matter if you told em or not. They could have followed
        you, you fool"
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: "Wouldn\u2019t they have come through here already?"
      speaker: David
    - text: "Could be waiting for nightfall \u2026 Anyhow, I think we need to punish
        you for risking our little livelihood here"
      speaker: Bandits
    - text: No come on please!
      speaker: David
    - text: Yeah, you know I think I know the exact lesson we should teach you
      speaker: David
