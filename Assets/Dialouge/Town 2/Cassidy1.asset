    - text: Wondered when you would show

    - text: "What happened to Jolene\u2019s body?"
      speaker: David
    - text: Buried her over there, reunited with our little girl

    - text: "How\u2019d it happen?"
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: They let me ask her some questions and then thought I had told the local
        deputies about them so they punished me through her
      speaker: David
    - text: "I see\u2026 you ask her about me"
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: I did
      speaker: David
    - text: "What\u2019d she say?"
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: She said you were amazing and that she blamed both her and you for what
        happened.
      speaker: David
    - text: Heh... Course she did
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: "I\u2019m sorry"
      speaker: David
    - text: "What good does that do her kid? If I had stayed, I might have been able
        to stop em. Instead, I\u2019m here living a lie."
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: "Why didn\u2019t you go back to the life or rejoin her?"
      speaker: David
    - text: "No reason to return to the life, without a person to take the money
        for or share it with. Couldn\u2019t return to her, didn\u2019t want to hurt
        her again"
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: Do you regret the things you did back then?
      speaker: David
    - text: Not really, at least not most of it. This for the book?
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: Yes and no. I think at this point after everything, I wanna try as much
        as possible to make all of this worth it
      speaker: David
    - text: "Let me save your conscience, kid. Those people would\u2019ve ended up
        dead anyway so don\u2019t bother worrying about that. Now whether this is
        worth the effort is going to depend on you and what you choose to do after
        all this"
