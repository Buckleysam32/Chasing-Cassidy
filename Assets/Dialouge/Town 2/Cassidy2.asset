    - text: Jesus, you got a lot of balls son. Most of the fools who approached me
        before you, stood there pissing their fucking pants the moment I even put
        my hand anywhere near my gun.
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: The way you describe your goal it almost sounds honourable and for you
        it probably seems that way but listen to me when I say this.
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: "It doesn\u2019t matter what stories you heard, this is not some land
        of the free and the fortunate\u2026 no this is a land of misfortune and death."
      speaker: Cassidy
    - text: "Most of the people living out here, fucking hate it, shit they would
        probably rather be any where else in the world but they can\u2019t either
        for personal reasons or they\u2019re just to fucking poor to make it out."

      speaker: David

        honest that chance died with my little girl."

            more after she found out what I\u2019d done. Didn\u2019t help that I
            eh felt responsible for what happened between us and I had nothin else
            left so I thought the best thing I could do was walk away and leave my
            money there"

            you had died or just disappeared because that would be easier than confronting
            you and facing the possibility that the one man I\u2019ve been risking
            my life to find, may just gun me down without question"

            too concerned about you, thought you\u2019d see the light and turn back
            or you just wouldn\u2019t make it. Even if you did, I probably would\u2019ve
            just answered your questions. But then I heard about Jolene"

            let anyone take advantage of her. Losing our daughter broke her"

            and when she found out about my past well lets just say she isn\u2019t
            \u2026 wasn\u2019t fond of lies. You know, I thought I would\u2019ve
            felt more considering how close we were but I guess after this much time
            and so much loss I\u2019ve become almost numb to it all."

            hurt, deserved it or would\u2019ve ended up dead anyway. Regret isn\u2019t
            something you can afford in this life, a conscience just gets you killed
            and lets be honest, you\u2019ve seen it. Life out here is unforgiving
            at best."
