      speaker: David
    - text: "Lotta questions for someone on that side of the table, I\u2019m used
        to hearing slurs and empty threats from people like you"
      speaker: Unknown
    - text: People like me?
      speaker: David
    - text: "Oh yes my bad I guess I shouldn\u2019t say that yet considering I don\u2019t
        know your relation yet but considering what I\u2019ve been through in the
        last couple hours, well you\u2019d understand"
      speaker: Unknown
    - text: "Right, I\u2019m getting side tracked. Your under arrest for your involvement
        in the case of Blaze's death. However depending on how you answer my questions
        will depend if that stays the case."
      speaker: Unknown
    - text: "Arghh what is with the people around here? So quick to distrust and
        resort to violence. Where\u2019s your Justice! Your respect! Your Humanity!"
      speaker: David
    - text: You want some humanity? Where was the humanity when our Sheriff was shot
        in cold blood? A man who was like a brother to me bleeds out in my arms trying
        to save the innocent
      speaker: Unknown
    - text: You want Justice? How about you start giving answers instead of demanding
        them!

      speaker: Unknown
    - text: Just ask your damn questions already
      speaker: David
    - text: Ok good. What were you planning to do after blaze killed himself. Why
        did you want to come to this shithole?
      speaker: Unknown
    - text: "I was told by someone that the person I\u2019m looking for was last
        seen in this town. This is Robertsville right?"
      speaker: David
    - text: "Yeah come on, drop the act. We both know you didn\u2019t just happen
        to be heading to town on this particular day"
      speaker: Unknown
    - text: "This is what I\u2019m talking about, Why can\u2019t you just believe
        me? I was heading in to find someone!"
      speaker: David
    - text: "Alright I\u2019ll play along, who were you looking for then?"

        fine. Let\u2019s get one thing straight then, Who are you?"

        book about Cold Cassid"

            be lying if it wasn\u2019t for the hope of some fortune and glory"
          speaker: David
        - text: The writer who survived the west and found Cold Cassidy! Oh I can
            understand that, yeah greed is common thing around here too
          speaker: Unknown
        - text: "I mean greed isn\u2019t the main reason, aren\u2019t you at least
            a little bit intrigued to find him, a missing outlaw, a ghost"
          speaker: David
        - text: Not really when I can go outside and take a piss on him anytime I
            want

            be one of them, let alone none of them would caught dead in an outfit
            like that"
          speaker: Unknown
        - text: I apologise for this, Name is Deputy, well Sheriff Knox and this
            is our office for the time being. Once again I apologise but we thought
            you might have been an outlaw
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: "Ok thanks I guess. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what's got
            you so on edge?"
          speaker: David
        - text: "Earlier today, a group of outlaws came into town and just started
            shooting people. We did what we could but it was three of us against
            five of them and we ain\u2019t exactly sharp shooters"
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: My condolences to the sheriff then, I sure he would be proud
          speaker: David
        - text: "Save it, it\u2019s not worth it when this town goes from 20 to two
            in one day. I\u2019ll have time for mourning later"
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: "Speaking of which, I need a favour. As you know, I\u2019m looking
            for Cassidy and do you know anywhere or anyone who may know his whereabouts?"
          speaker: David
        - text: "Didn\u2019t you hear me? He\u2019s dead, graves in our very own
            cemetery."
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: "I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t think that's him. I spoke to his
            former partner and he didn\u2019t mention any death."
          speaker: David
        - text: There might be some evidence to that, the previous sheriff did mention
            that the grave just popped up one day with no involvement from anyone
            in town
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: "So if it really means that much to you, we did manage to captured
            one of the fuckers that torched this town, we\u2019ve set him up to hang
            as bait but something tells me, his crew ain\u2019t coming back"
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: What exactly does that have to do with anything?
          speaker: David
        - text: "His crew, tried to capture some of the women that lived here and
            mentioned that they\u2019ll go well with \u2018Cassidy\u2019s whore\u2019,
            might not be the same Cassidy but it's worth a look"
          speaker: Sheriff Knox
        - text: "So what do you want me to do with him once I\u2019m done?"
          speaker: David
        - text: "We done all the setup, all you need to do is pull the lever and
            hang 'em or leave' em, it\u2019s up to you. Just don\u2019t set that
            bastard free, if you don\u2019t hang him I will"
          speaker: 'Sheriff Knox '
        - text: Thanks, I'll deal with him...
          speaker: David
        - text: "Good, now run along already, by the way your horse should be out
            front when you\u2019re ready to go"
